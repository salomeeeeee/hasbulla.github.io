        <p class = "text2">Who is Hasbulla Magomedov?</p>
        <p class="text">Hasbulla was born on 7th July 2002 and is 20 years old, although he has a babyface, childlike features and a high-pitched voice. Hasbulla Magomedov was born and grew up in Makhachkala, Dagestan. He took to social media during the height of the pandemic and began posting content to Instagram and TikTok where his notability grew dramatically. Early social media posts showed his hotheaded nature and the high jinks of his life. Later posts saw him sporting fighting gear, routinely boxing, striking & grounding opponents in the gym. </p>
        <p class = "text2">What is Hasbulla’s Condition?</p>
        <p class="text">Hasbulla has Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) or ‘Dwarfism’. It’s a rare genetic condition that affects some notable stars, including Lionel Messi who is well known to have been diagnosed with GHD when he was 11 years old. The monthly treatment billings were expected to cost $900 USD, but for a more accurate representation of how treatment for GHD is taken care of in Australia, see this referring Government document. </p>
        <p class = "text2">What is Hasbulla’s Net Worth?</p>
        <p class="text"> Since blowing up on TikTok, there have been many questions surrounding Hasbulla’s net worth. According to reports, his social media status and promotional works, have seen Hasbulla’s net worth swell to over USD$200,000 with an average monthly income of USD$80,000. It’s worth noting that this figure is an estimation, and if the Hasbulla vs Abdu Rozik fight would go ahead you can expect that figure to climb dramatically.</p>

      <p class="text2">Hasbulla Boxing Efforts</p>
      <p class = "text">Since Dagestan has been a steady supplier of formidable MMA fighters, to hop on to the herd mentality, Hasbulla has taken to boxing and mixed martial arts. The miniature fighter’s social media is heavy with videos of him bridging up to peers double his size and taking a jab at the camera.

        And due to his camaraderie and go-getting nature, his posts also show him routinely weight training, sparing and grounding opponents in the gym — but that’s probably just for show and antics — and the gradual progression of his training techniques, combination strikes and submissions</p>
      <p class="text2">Why is Hasbulla Famous?</p>
      <p class = "text">In May 2021, his popularity exploded after his pre-fight press conference with popular 17-year-old Tajikistan singer Abdu Rozik. Despite being born with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD), aka dwarfism, this has not curbed the charisma and commitment of the fighter to accepting challenges and calling out the likes of former UFC featherweight, lightweight, and current Twitter, champion Conor McGregor. So if you’ve mistaken him for some spoilt youngling when arbitrarily flicking through your Instagram — you’re not alone.</p>

        <p class = "text2">Hasbulla Enemies</p>
        <p class="text">Hasbulla has two enemies, Abdu Rozik (who he has a long history with) and his new challenger Erali Boyqobilov. </p>
        <p class = "text2">Hasbulla vs. Abdu Rozik</p>
        <p class="text">In a recent interview with Barstool Sports, Hasbulla re-energised tensions with Abdu Rozik, claiming the next time he sees Rozik it is “on sight,” and that he’ll “throw a hook,” continuing on to say “how about you put us both in a room and close the door, one man will walk out and the other can stay slumped on the floor”.

          Say what you want about their size, but this pre-fight press conference, like any major UFC one, was purely a case of testosterone poisoning. From name-calling to cheap shots, barking to physical challenges and personal attacks to exposing one another’s shortcomings. The Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik pre-fight press conference, – which was really a sit down in a living room of a humdrum house – is what the fight world is waiting for. Seeing the two pints trade barbs with their squeaky voices most probably had every viewer piss themself and set fire to the comment section.
          
          “It’s not even like a show fight — they get paid a lot of money and it’s a show to make people laugh. There’s nothing serious about this, this isn’t sport. This is unethical, wrong, from my point of view.” – Head of the association, Uliana Podpalnaya.
          
          According to Chechen Fighter Ashab Tamaev, the pair is set to battle it out in mid-to-late June (that never happened). But the matchup between two teenagers with dwarfism has been condemned by the Russian Dwarf Athletic Association for being “unethical”. </p>
        <p class = "text2">Hasbulla vs. Erali Boyqobilov</p>
        <p class="text"> In a video linked below, Hasbulla’s latest enemy appears to be Erali Boyqobilov who recently stepped in the ring with Abdu Rozik. While the video is too blurry to confirm the identity of Erali, if the pair were confirmed to be beefing again it would reignite a history that dates back to January 2022 when a pre-fight video went viral showing the two having a stare-down.
          Information about Erali Boyqobilov is limited, however, the personality lists himself as a blogger from Uzbekistan.
